Avp Jag Map Layout Format Notes
WIP - still lots of bytes to identify in levels that aren't Sublevel 3

maze data starts at 0x0004FC00

there is an 8 byte header directly above this
it has number of sectors in the x and y directions as the first 4 bytes

for sub level 3, this is 0x40 x 0x40 = 0x1000 (4096) sectors in the grid

each sector is defined by 8 bytes
so to know how many bytes to dump just multiply by 0x8 - 0x40 x 0x40 x 0x8 = 0x8000 (32768)

The grid is laid out with sector 0,0 in the top left, and the data is stored as rows running from left to right. 
IE Sector 0,0 ... sector 63,0 then sector 0,1 ... sector 63,1 
and so on all the way through to sector 63,63. 
Each sector is described by 8 bytes.

So to find the offset for the starting sector in the map data
Using debug mode cheat, the marine start sector is (decimal) 36,10 (ie x = 36, y = 10)
						  Y              X
0x4FC00 + ((0x40 * 0x8 * 0a) + (0x8 * 0x24) 
//IE find the 10th row starting offset, then the 36th sector in that row
So 0x00051120 is marine start in sub level 3


8 bytes define a sector using the following format:

a b c d e f g h

Assuming the player is facing 'north' towards the top of the grid, they have the following definitions

a: left side wall definition (each byte represents a different wall texture / door / strut. Can also be empty)
b: front side wall definition
c: right side wall definition
d: back side wall definition
e: ceiling definition definition
f: floor definition
g: 1st flag
h: 2nd flag
